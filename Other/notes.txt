anomalous measurements

-> Netlist CounterOutEnable is tied low with measured 180 ohm resistance (expect ~47Kohm)
->RegRead and ALU_regs should be tied high in the design but theyre not (surgery reuired)
-> No pull resistors on any load enable pin (critical for operation)
-> Pull resistors on RAM chips are very strange
-> resistance from 5V to ground seems anomalous
-> D0 on the main bus is high anomalously (damage to a chip that drives that signal?)
-> Port C and D read are on the wrong chip should be swaped with Port A and B latch

-> LDA and LDB insturction don't really make sense due to the swap in Port C and Port D


!!!!-> THE (PC and PD read) and (PA PB latch) traces have been scratched out in prep for jumper wires to be connected.
